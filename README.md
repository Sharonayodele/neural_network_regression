# Neural Network Regression
Regression problems are tasks to predict a continuous numerical E.g Predict the prices of houses based on given features, predict the cost of medical insurance.

I am going to use 2 exercises to practice all the steps involved in an end-to-end regression model

Exercise 1: predicting on simple test data(arithmetic progression)
Exercise 2: regression problem on **the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on some different parameters
